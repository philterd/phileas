# Replacement

Replacement is a method of de-identification that simply replaces a sensitive value with another value. Replacement is useful when the sensitive value is not needed once the document has been de-identified. Philter can replace a sensitive value with a preset value or with a random value.

In Philter's filter strategies, replacement is achieved by using the strategy to `REDACT`, `STATIC_REPLACE` , or `RANDOM_REPLACE` .
