Examples of bucketing is Philter can bucket dates into years, and zip codes by population. <p>A difference between Philter and other services is that Philter does not send your data to a third-party for de-identification.

Phileas will store the information needed to disambiguate spans in the cache such that the information is available to each instance of Phileas. If only a single instance of Phileas is running then the cache service is not required, however, the information needed to disambiguate spans will be stored in memory and will be lost when Phileas is stopped or restarted. Because of this, we recommend the cache service always be used unless there is a specific reason not to.</p>"},{"location":"other_features/span_disambiguation/#fine-tuning-the-span-disambiguation","title":"Fine-Tuning the Span Disambiguation","text":"<p>There are properties available to fine-tune how the span disambiguation operates.
