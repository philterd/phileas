The Company will host a conference call and webcast today commencing at 2:00 pm Vancouver time to discuss the Company's business strategy and objectives, first quarter results and activities underway at the Company's projects. Further details are provided at the end of this news release. Equinox Gold had a strong first quarter bolstered by production from our newly acquired assets and achieved record gold production and record earnings from mine operations, despite navigating challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, {{{REDACTED-person}}}, Chief Executive Officer. With more than $350 million of cash on hand, Equinox Gold is in a strong financial position and fully funded for its organic growth plans. Castle Mountain Phase 1 construction is 75% complete, the Los Filos expansion and Santa Luz restart projects are expected to significantly increase production over the course of 2021 and 2022 and we recently completed a positive preliminary economic assessment for development of an underground mine at Aurizona. While the temporary suspension of mining activities at our Los Filos mine in Mexico will affect Q2 production, our other mines have experienced only minimal COVID-19 disruption to date. We remain focused on achieving our growth objectives while continuing to maintain appropriate operational and safety procedures to help protect the health and economic wellbeing of our workforce and local communities.

Each of the Company's operations has implemented preventive measures in collaboration with the Company's employees, contractors, local communities and governments to help ensure the health, safety and economic wellbeing of the Company's workforce and local communities. The Company has also evaluated supply chain and other risks at each operation and implemented business continuity protocols so the mines can operate as effectively as possible. The Company's operations have experienced limited disruption to date, with the exception of the Company's Los Filos mine in Mexico at which mining and development activities were suspended at the beginning of April in compliance with a Mexico Federal Government order requiring the temporary suspension of all non-essential businesses. On {{{REDACTED-date}}} the Mexico Federal Government declared mining an essential activity and allowed for the restart of operations on {{{REDACTED-date}}}. The Company is preparing to safely resume operations. Additional information regarding Equinox Gold's COVID-19 response plan, preventive measures taken to date and the potential impact on operations is available in the Q1 2020 management's discussion and analysis and on the Company's website at {{{REDACTED-url}}}. The Company drew the remaining $180 million from its $400 million revolving credit facility in late March as a proactive measure given the uncertainty of the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operations. There are no current plans to spend these funds and Equinox Gold remains in a strong financial position with more than $350 million in cash and cash equivalents (unrestricted) at the date of this news release.

CEO commentary:  J{{{REDACTED-person}}}, President and {{{REDACTED-person}}}, made the following comments in relation to 2020 second-quarter results. Kinross had a strong second quarter, as we generated robust free cash flow, more than doubled earnings year-over-year, and continued to strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Our margins increased 53% year-over-year, well above the 31% increase in the average realized gold price. Our portfolio of mines performed well and continued production during the quarter, with our three largest producing mines – Paracatu, Kupol and Tasiast – delivering the lowest costs. We have been able to effectively manage COVID-19 impacts on our portfolio of mines during the first half of the year, as our comprehensive pandemic response plan continued to help protect the health of our employees and communities, while supporting the successful continuation of our business. Although we prudently withdrew our full-year guidance given the potential impacts of the pandemic on our operations, we continue to work towards the safe delivery of our annual targets. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their dedication, hard work and commitment to safety during these challenging times. During the quarter, we announced an agreement in principle with the Government of Mauritania that enhances our partnership and will provide further stability for the long-term success of our Tasiast mine. Earlier this month, we also announced an addition of 6.4 million ounces to our gold reserve estimates with the completion of the Lobo-Marte pre-feasibility study. This high-quality asset increases our reserve life index and further enhances optionality on our long-term development project pipeline. For the first half of the year, more than 50% of our production came from the Americas, and more than 80% from five key assets in five diverse regions. With the recent acquisition in Russia, and taking into account our track record of exploration success, we expect these assets and regions will continue to produce for at least 10 years. Summary of financial and operating results (a) Total includes 100% of Chirano production. Attributable includes Kinross' share of Chirano (90%) production (b) The definition and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included on pages 14 to 19 of this news release (c) Gold equivalent ounces include silver ounces produced and sold converted to a gold equivalent based on a ratio of the average spot market prices for the commodities for each period. The ratio for the second quarter of 2020 was 104.49:1 (second quarter of 2019: 87.98:1). The ratio for the first six months of 2020 was 98.85:1 (first six months of 2019: 85.78:1) (d) Capital expenditures is as reported as Additions to property, plant and equipment on the interim condensed consolidated statement of cash flows and excludes Interest paid capitalized to property, plant and equipment. The following operating and financial results are based on 2020 second-quarter gold equivalent production. Production and cost measures are on an attributable basis: Production1: Kinross produced 571,978 attributable Au eq. oz. in Q2 2020, compared with 648,251 Au eq. oz. in Q2 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower production at Paracatu, Round Mountain and Chirano, partially offset by higher production at Bald Mountain and Kupol. Production cost of sales1,3: Production cost of sales per Au eq. oz. was $725 for Q2 2020, compared with $663 for Q2 2019. Production cost of sales per Au oz. on a by-product basis was $707 in Q2 2020, compared with $650 in Q2 2019, based on Q2 2020 attributable gold sales of 574,299 ounces and attributable silver sales of 1,063,572 ounces. All-in sustaining cost1,3: All-in sustaining cost per Au eq. oz. sold was $984 in Q2 2020, compared with $925 in Q2 2019. All-in sustaining cost per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis was $971 in Q2 2020, compared with $918 in Q2 2019. Revenue: Revenue from metal sales increased 20% to $1,007.2 million in Q2 2020, compared with $837.8 million during the same period in 2019. Average realized gold price7: The average realized gold price in Q2 2020 increased 31% to $1,712 per ounce, compared with $1,307 per ounce in Q2 2019. Margins: Kinross’ attributable margin per Au eq. oz. sold4 increased 53% to $987 per Au eq. oz. for Q2 2020, compared with the Q2 2019 margin of $644 per Au eq. oz. sold. Operating cash flow: Adjusted operating cash flow3 for Q2 2020 increased significantly by 45% to $416.9 million, compared with $287.7 million for Q2 2019, primarily due to the increase in margins. Net operating cash flow was $432.8 million for Q2 2020, an increase of 30% compared with $333.0 million for Q2 2019. Earnings: Adjusted net earnings3 more than doubled to $194.0 million, or $0.15 per share, for Q2 2020, compared with adjusted net earnings of $79.6 million, or $0.06 per share, for Q2 2019, primarily due to the increase in margins. Reported net earnings2 also more than doubled to $195.7 million, or $0.16 per share, for Q2 2020, compared with net earnings of $71.5 million, or $0.06 per share, in Q2 2019. The increase was mainly due to higher operating earnings and a non-cash impairment reversal of $48.3 million at Lobo-Marte as a result of the addition of mineral reserves at the project in conjunction with the recently completed pre-feasibility study, partially offset by the increase in income tax expense in Q2 2020. Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures were $214.3 million for Q2 2020, compared with $275.8 million for the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in spending at Tasiast as a result of impacts of the pandemic on stripping rates, and decreases at Bald Mountain and Round Mountain. As of {{{REDACTED-date}}}, Kinross had cash and cash equivalents of $1,527.1 million, which increased compared with $1,138.6 million at {{{REDACTED-date}}}. The quarter-over-over increase was due to free cash flow generated during Q2 2020 and the $200 million drawdown from the Tasiast project financing. The Company had additional available credit of $811.2 million as of {{{REDACTED-date}}}, and total liquidity of approximately $2.3 billion, with no scheduled debt repayments until {{{REDACTED-date}}}. The Company had total debt of approximately $2.7 billion, which includes the $750 million draw from the revolving credit facility in the first quarter and the $200 million in Tasiast project financing, and net debt8 of approximately $1.1 billion. Kinross has further improved its debt metrics, including its net debt to EBITDA ratio. The Company drew down from its revolving credit facility in {{{REDACTED-date}}} as a precautionary measure to protect against economic and business uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company repaid $250 million of the drawn amount on {{{REDACTED-date}}} given the increase in the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and its strong financial position, and does not plan to deploy the remaining funds. On {{{REDACTED-date}}}, Kinross extended the maturity date of its $300 million letter of credit guarantee facility with Export Development Canada for two years to {{{REDACTED-date}}}. All of Kinross’ mines continued production during Q2 2020, as the Company’s ongoing response to COVID-19 safeguarded the health and safety of employees and host communities and mitigated material operational impacts to the portfolio. However, COVID-19 did partially affect overall performance and productivity rates, mainly as a result of global travel constraints and the implementation of rigorous safety protocols and measures at all mines and projects. Mine-by-mine summaries for 2020 second-quarter results can be found on pages nine and 13 of this news release. Operational highlights from Q2 2020 include the following: Paracatu performed well during the quarter, with production increasing compared with Q1 2020 mainly due to higher mill throughput and grades, while cost of sales per ounce sold decreased largely as a result of favourable foreign exchange rates. Production was lower compared with Q2 2019’s record performance, as grades and recoveries decreased as planned. Cost of sales per ounce sold was higher year-over-year mainly due to the lower production, which was offset by favourable foreign exchange rates. At Round Mountain, production was lower quarter-over-quarter mainly due to fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads, and decreased year-over-year mainly due to lower mill grades. Cost of sales per ounce sold was higher versus Q1 2020 and Q2 2019 largely due to lower production as a result of fewer ounces from the heap leach pads, with higher maintenance and contractor costs also contributing to the increase year-over-year. Bald Mountain had good performance during the quarter, as production increased compared with Q1 2020 and Q2 2019 largely as a result of more ounces recovered from the Vantage Complex heap leach pad and higher grades. Cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with Q1 2020 mainly due to higher cost ounces recovered from the heap leach pads, and was largely in line with Q2 2019. At Fort Knox, production increased compared with Q1 2020 primarily as a result of higher mill grades and recoveries, while cost of sales per ounce sold decreased mainly due to higher mill grades and lower energy costs. Production was largely in line year-over-year, with cost of sales per ounce sold increasing mainly due to a higher percentage of operating waste mined and higher maintenance costs, partially offset by lower energy costs. The Russia region continued its strong and consistent performance during the quarter, with production at Kupol and Dvoinoye increasing quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, mainly due to higher gold grades. Cost of sales per ounce sold was lower compared with Q1 2020 largely as a result of favourable foreign exchange rates, and was higher versus Q2 2019 mainly due to higher royalties associated with the increase in the average realized gold price. At Tasiast, production was lower compared with Q1 2020 and Q2 2019 mainly due to the 17-day strike during the quarter and mine sequencing, which was slightly offset by higher grades. The principal impact of COVID-19 was a lower-than-planned mining rate, which resulted in deferrals of some stripping and associated capital expenditures. Production is expected to increase during the second half of the year, and, as a result, 2020 production is not expected to be materially impacted by the deferrals. Throughput performance adjusted for the impact of the strike continued to be strong, with average daily rates slightly better than the record performance in Q1 2020. Cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with the previous quarter mainly due to the lower production and impacts from COVID-19. Cost of sales per ounce sold decreased compared with the previous year mainly due to lower fuel and overhead costs. In 2021, stripping rates and capital expenditures are expected to be higher compared to those presented in the Tasiast Technical Report as the mine makes up for the stripping deferred from 2020. A modest reduction in 2021 gold production is also expected compared to the Technical Report due to a longer-than-planned period of stockpile feed and delayed access to higher grade ore. The Company expects no impacts to Tasiast’s life of mine production, mineral reserve estimates and overall value, and was able to adjust short-term mine plans given the availability of large stockpiles at site. At Chirano, production was lower quarter-over-quarter mainly due to temporary downtime at the mill and decreased mining rates from COVID-19 impacts, both of which were slightly offset by higher grades, while cost of sales per ounce sold decreased mainly due to lower operating waste mined. Production decreased compared with the previous year mainly due to lower throughput, grades and recoveries, with cost of sales per ounce sold increasing mainly due to higher operating waste mined. The Tasiast 24k project continues to advance and remains on schedule to increase throughput capacity to 21,000 t/d by the end of 2021, and then to 24,000 t/d by mid-2023. During Q2 2020, COVID-19 impacts affected progress on power plant construction, while civil works in the processing plant, including the gravity circuit, thickener and screens, progressed well. The project team continues to explore measures to mitigate potential impacts of prolonged constraints on the global movement of people and supplies, which could affect the project schedule. However, by late June, the Company reinstated more regular rotations of expatriate staff in Mauritania, which has improved the situation. The Fort Knox Gilmore project continues to progress well and is on schedule and on budget, with the new Barnes Creek heap leach expected to be completed in Q4 2020. Stripping is advancing well and the project is now approximately 80% complete. At the Chulbatkan development project in Russia, the 2020 drill program is ramping back up after COVID-19-related challenges reduced drilling rates in the second quarter and remains on track to be completed by year-end. As of the end of Q2 2020, approximately 35,500 metres of infill, step-out and metallurgical drilling was completed, with drilling confirming the well disseminated nature of the orebody, including large lower grade intercepts, combined with pockets of high grade intercepts. In the third quarter, the drilling program will focus on further defining the high-grade zone of the known resource through additional tight-spaced drilling. The project currently has a large, near-surface estimated mineral resource, with highly continuous mineralization that is open along strike and at depth. At the La Coipa Restart project, work is ramping up after limitations on people movement challenged the project in the first quarter. Mining crews are being mobilized and fleet rebuilds are commencing in preparation for pre-stripping, which is expected to start in early 2021, with first production expected in mid-2022. The project team continues to study opportunities to optimize the mine plan and potentially extend mine life. On {{{REDACTED-date}}}, Kinross announced results for the Lobo-Marte pre-feasibility study (PFS). The project added a significant 6.4 million gold ounces5 to Kinross’ 2019 year-end probable mineral reserve estimates and increased the Company’s reserve life index by approximately 2.5 years6. The PFS estimate includes total life of mine production of approximately 4.5 million Au oz. during a 15-year mine life, and pending a positive development decision, is expected to commence production after the conclusion of mining at the La Coipa project. The long-term Lobo-Marte project provides Kinross with an excellent, organic development option that has attractive all-in sustaining costs and strong returns at the consensus long-term gold price. The project is expected to realize significant upside value and increase margins at higher gold prices without having to increase stripping or current cost estimates as the pit design would remain based on a $1,200/oz. gold price. The Company plans to commence a feasibility study later this year, with scheduled completion in Q4 2021, and will continue to prioritize balance sheet strength and disciplined capital allocation as it moves forward with the project. Exploration activities during the first half of the year continued to focus on promising targets around current operations, and areas where existing infrastructure can be leveraged, with the goal of extending mine life and adding to the Company’s mineral reserve and resource estimates. Highlights include: Kupol: During the first half of the year, exploration within the existing footprint of Russia operations were very encouraging, with positive results from the Kupol NE Extension, Kupol Deeps South, Moroshka and Providence. Exploration will continue to focus on these targets for the rest of 2020, with the goal of adding significant ounces to Kupol’s mineral reserve and resource estimates at year-end and extending mine life. Chirano: Exploration at Chirano showed promising results during the first half of the year as the Company continued to target multi-year mine life extensions. To date, a total of approximately 29,000 metres of drilling was completed at the Akwaaba, Tano, Obra and Mamnao West areas. At Obra, drilling yielded significant results and has extended the depth of high-grade mineralization. For the second half of the year, Kinross will continue to explore the underground mining potential at Obra by commencing initial works on an exploration drift to drill from the underground in order to increase accuracy and targeting. Drilling will also continue to explore the extensions of Akwaaba, Tano and Suraw, and the potential for open pit mining at Mamnao West. Round Mountain: At Round Mountain, drilling continued at Phase X, which is the northwest continuation of Phase W mineralization. Results received to date have been encouraging, as drilling has intersected significant mineralization in the upper portions within the shallow portion of Phase X to potentially optimize the pit shell design, and confirmed that mineralization extends from Phase W. Further drilling is assessing mineralization to reduce the strip ratio at Phase X. Curlew Basin Project: The 2020 Curlew exploration program has focused on areas around the historical K2 mine, which is located approximately 35 kilometres north of the Kettle River mill. The program added 162 Au koz. with grades of 8.8 g/t to Kinross’ indicated mineral resource estimates at year-end 2019, and high level engineering and economic assessment of potential mining at the Curlew Basin achieved encouraging results during the first half of the year. Exploration activities will continue to target incremental high-margin ounces proximal to and extensions of the K2 and K5 deposits by constructing a series of exploration drifts to explore the highly prospective areas. The drifts will allow for underground drilling that will test the large prospective ground at optimal drill angles and at expected lower costs. Exploration work for the second half of the year is expected to also continue at the Company’s other brownfield targets, including Fort Knox, Bald Mountain and La Coipa. As well, Kinross expects to focus on growing mineral resource estimates at Tasiast Sud in Mauritania and progressing work at district targets around Kupol-Dvoinoye in Russia. Agreement in principle with Government of Mauritania On {{{REDACTED-date}}}, Kinross reached an agreement in principle with the Government of Mauritania to resolve outstanding matters between the parties. The terms are subject to finalizing definitive agreements and provide Kinross with a 30-year exploitation license for Tasiast Sud, with expedited permitting and the possibility of early mining. The terms also provide for the reinstatement of a tax exemption on fuel duties and repayment by the Government to Kinross of outstanding VAT refunds. Kinross also volunteered to update the royalty structure for Tasiast so it is tied to the gold price, is in line with Mauritania’s current mining conventions and codes, and further aligns interests by ensuring the country receives an appropriate share of economic benefits from the Tasiast mine. 2020 Guidance The following section of the news release represents forward-looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary. We refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information on page 20 of this news release. On {{{REDACTED-date}}}, the Company made the prudent decision to withdraw its full-year guidance. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted Kinross’ overall business performance during the first half of the year, the pandemic continues to present the potential for further business disruptions. To date, Kinross’ ongoing and comprehensive response to the pandemic has enabled the Company to safeguard employees and local communities, help prevent the spread of COVID-19, and mitigate operational risk. The Company continues to target the safe delivery of its operating plans and is on track to meet its original 2020 guidance for production, cost of sales per ounce sold, all-in sustaining cost per ounce sold and capital expenditures.

Kinross’ 2020 second-quarter unaudited Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis have been filed with Canadian securities regulators (available at ) and furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (available at ). Kinross shareholders may obtain a copy of the financial statements free of charge upon request to the Company. Kinross is a Canadian-based senior gold mining company with mines and projects in the United States, Brazil, Russia, Mauritania, Chile and Ghana. Kinross maintains listings on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol:K) and the New York Stock Exchange (symbol:KGC). (a) Tonnes of ore mined and processed represent 100% Kinross for all periods presented. (b) Due to the nature of heap leach operations, recovery rates at Maricunga and Bald Mountain cannot be accurately measured on a quarterly basis. Recovery rates at Fort Knox, Round Mountain and Tasiast represent mill recovery only. (c) The Kupol segment includes the Kupol and Dvoinoye mines. (d) Kupol silver grade and recovery were as follows: Q2 2020: 70.36 g/t, 86.1% Q1 2020: 80.02 g/t, 84.1% Q4 2019: 65.63 g/t, 84.8%; Q3 2019: 67.44 g/t, 87.8%; Q2 2019: 75.29 g/t, 84.9% (e) Gold equivalent ounces include silver ounces produced and sold converted to a gold equivalent based on the ratio of the average spot market prices for the commodities for each period.

(h) nm means not meaningful. The Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document. These measures are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers. Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP measures which determine the performance of the Company, excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance for the reporting period, such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, reassessment of prior year taxes and/or taxes otherwise not related to the current period, impairment charges (reversals), gains and losses and other one-time costs related to acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions, and non-hedge derivative gains and losses. Although some of the items are recurring, the Company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Management believes that these measures, which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results, provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance, particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance. However, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share measures are not necessarily indicative of net earnings and earnings per share measures as determined under IFRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented: (a) During the three and six months ended {{{REDACTED-date}}}, the Company recognized a non-cash reversal of impairment charge of $48.3 million related to property, plant and equipment at Lobo-Marte. (b) Includes $6.0 million of Tasiast strike costs. The Company makes reference to a non-GAAP measure for adjusted operating cash flow. Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company’s regular operating cash flow, and excluding changes in working capital. Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors, including the timing of tax payments, and in the case of Kupol, a build-up of inventory due to transportation logistics. The Company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow-generating capability of the Company. However, the adjusted operating cash flow measure is not necessarily indicative of net cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow for the periods presented: Consolidated production cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as production cost of sales as per the interim condensed consolidated financial statements divided by the total number of gold equivalent ounces sold. This measure converts the Company’s non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and credits it to total production.  Attributable production cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as attributable production cost of sales divided by the attributable number of gold equivalent ounces sold. This measure converts the Company’s non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and credits it to total production. Management uses these measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its operating properties. The following table presents a reconciliation of consolidated and attributable production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold for the periods presented: Attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP measure which calculates the Company’s non-gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs, rather than converting its non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production, as is the case in co-product accounting. Management believes that this measure provides investors with the ability to better evaluate Kinross’ production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by-product accounting rather than co-product accounting.  The following table provides a reconciliation of attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis for the periods presented: In {{{REDACTED-date}}}, the World Gold Council (WGC) published updates to its guidelines for reporting all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs to address how the costs associated with leases, after a company’s adoption of IFRS 16, should be treated. The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including Kinross. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non-GAAP measures. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, these measures presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost measures complement existing measures reported by Kinross.  All-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. The value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production. Sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. All-in cost is comprised of all-in sustaining cost as well as operating expenditures incurred at locations with no current operation, or costs related to other non-sustaining activities, and capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Attributable all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis are calculated by adjusting total production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations, as follows:   The Company also assesses its all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis. Under these non-GAAP measures, the Company’s production of silver is converted into gold equivalent ounces and credited to total production.  Attributable all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost per equivalent ounce sold are calculated by adjusting total production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations, as follows: (a) The portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest represents the non-controlling interest (10%) in the production cost of sales for the Chirano mine. (b) Attributable includes Kinross' share of Chirano (90%) production. (c) Attributable silver revenues represents the attributable portion of metal sales realized from the production of the secondary or by-product metal (i.e. silver). Revenue from the sale of silver, which is produced as a by-product of the process used to produce gold, effectively reduces the cost of gold production. (d) General and administrative expenses is as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations, net of certain restructuring expenses. General and administrative expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required to be absorbed on a continuing basis for the effective operation and governance of the Company. (e) Other operating expense – sustaining is calculated as Other operating expense as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations, less other operating and reclamation and remediation expenses related to non-sustaining activities as well as other items not reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. Other operating expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on the type and location of the expenditure incurred. The majority of other operating expenses that are incurred at existing operations are considered costs necessary to sustain operations, and are therefore classified as sustaining. Other operating expenses incurred at locations where there is no current operation or related to other non-sustaining activities are classified as non-sustaining. (f) Reclamation and remediation - sustaining is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets, and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines. Reclamation and remediation costs for development projects or closed mines are excluded from this amount and classified as non-sustaining. (g) Exploration and business development – sustaining is calculated as Exploration and business development expenses as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statement of operations, less non-sustaining exploration expenses. Exploration expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type and location of the exploration expenditure. Exploration expenditures within the footprint of operating mines are considered costs required to sustain current operations and so are included in sustaining costs. Exploration expenditures focused on new ore bodies near existing mines (i.e. brownfield), new exploration projects (i.e. greenfield) or for other generative exploration activity not linked to existing mining operations are classified as non-sustaining. Business development expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required for general operations. (h) Additions to property, plant and equipment – sustaining represents the majority of capital expenditures at existing operations including capitalized exploration costs, periodic capitalized stripping and underground mine development costs, ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and other capital expenditures and is calculated as total additions to property, plant and equipment (as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows), less capitalized interest and non-sustaining capital. Non-sustaining capital represents capital expenditures for major projects, including major capital stripping projects at existing operations that are expected to materially benefit the operation, as well as enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Non-sustaining capital expenditures during the three and six months ended {{{REDACTED-date}}}, primarily related to major projects at Tasiast, Round Mountain and Fort Knox. Non-sustaining capital expenditures during the three and six months ended {{{REDACTED-date}}}, primarily related to major projects at Tasiast, Round Mountain, and Bald Mountain. (i) Lease payments – sustaining represents the majority of lease payments as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is made up of the principal and financing components of such cash payments, less non-sustaining lease payments. Lease payments for development projects or closed mines are classified as non-sustaining. (j) Portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest represents the non-controlling interest (10%) in the ounces sold from the Chirano mine. (k) Average realized gold price per ounce is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as gold metal sales divided by the total number of gold ounces sold. This measure is intended to enable Management to better understand the price realized in each reporting period. The realized price measure does not have any standardized definition under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for measure of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. 1) Unless otherwise stated, production, production costs of sales per Au eq. oz., and all-in-sustaining costs per Au eq. oz., in this news release are based on Kinross’ 90% share of Chirano production. 2) Net earnings figures in this release represent net earnings attributable to common shareholders. 3) These figures are non-GAAP financial measures and are defined and reconciled on pages 14 to 19 of this news release. 4) Attributable margin per equivalent ounce sold is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as average realized gold price per ounce less attributable production cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold. 5) For more information on Lobo-Marte’s mineral reserve and resource estimates, see Kinross’ news release dated {{{REDACTED-date}}} on kinross.com. 6) Calculated as estimated 2019 proven and probable gold reserves divided by 2019 gold production. 7) Average realized gold price is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as gold metal sales divided by the total number of gold ounces sold. 8) Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Long-term debt and credit facilities less Cash and cash equivalents. 9) Refers to all of the currencies in the countries where the Company has mining operations, fluctuating simultaneously by 10% in the same direction, either appreciating or depreciating, taking into consideration the impact of hedging and the weighting of each currency within our consolidated cost structure.

        Assertions.assertEquals("Social media posts falsely claim donations ma{{{REDACTED-person}}} on the Black Lives Matter website go directly to the Democratic Party, because the group uses ActBlue Charities — an online fundraising platform. Donations go to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. The funds first pass through a nonprofit that sponsors the group. As the Black Lives Matter movement captures national attention, websites and social media posts are spreading a false claim about donations made to a leading Black Lives Matter organization. An Instagram {{{REDACTED-person}}} for the website WokeHub.com claimed, for example, that donations made to Black Lives Matter website go directly to the DNC and that BlackLivesMatter.com appears to be an international money laundering program used by the Democratic National Committee. A similar claim appeared on the conspiracy theory website InfoWars.com. Conservative personality {{{REDACTED-person}}} also put the claim before her more than 1 million followers on Instagram, where she claimed BLACK LIVES MATTER FUNDING GOES DIRECTLY TO WHITE DEMOCRATS AND THEIR VARIOUS INITIATIVES TO GET DEMOCRATS INTO OFFICE. But the claims — perhaps worsened by public confusion over the structure of the organization, which we’ll explain later — are based on a distortion of facts regarding the nonprofit ActBlue, which provides fundraising infrastructure to Democratic campaigns and progressive organizations. There are a number of groups that use the phrase Black Lives Matter in their name. There is a Black Lives Matter Foundation, for example, whose president confirmed to us that it is not related to the organization behind BlackLivesMatter.com — which is at the center of the viral claims. BlackLivesMatter.com is operated by an umbrella Black Lives Matter organization called the Black Lives Matter Global Network. The effort started in 2013 following the acquittal of {{{REDACTED-person}}} in the killing of Tray{{{REDACTED-person}}}. To collect donations, the website uses ActBlue Charities, a 501(c)(3) organization that specifically makes the platform available to charitable organizations. {{{REDACTED-person}}} Instagram post features a video showing that BlackLivesMatter.com uses ActBlue for its donations. It then shows an OpenSecrets.org breakdown of expenditures by ActBlue made in the 2020 cycle; the top recipients are the presidential campaigns of Sen. {{{REDACTED-person}}}, former Vice President {{{REDACTED-person}}}, and Sen. {{{REDACTED-person}}}. But the video misrepresents how ActBlue works. ActBlue isn’t itself donating money. It’s just the online platform that campaigns and groups use to solicit and collect donations. Campaign finance experts told us that it’s false to say that donations to the Black Lives Matter group are going to the Democratic National Committee, or to Democratic presidential campaigns, simply because the website uses ActBlue. ActBlue lets candidates and liberal nonprofit organizations set up their separate accounts, {{{REDACTED-person}}}, director of the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, told us in a phone interview. There’s no crossing from one account to another. If you give the money to Sanders, it does not go to Biden. Malbin — a professor of political science at the University at Albany, State University of New York — said candidates and organizations use ActBlue for the ease of transactions. ActBlue has no discretion over where to direct individuals’ contributions, he said. The money you see coming through ActBlue is coming through it, not from it. A similar platform used for Republican fundraising efforts, WinRed, launched in 2019. When you donate on an ActBlue or ActBlue Charities page, the donation is earmarked for the group listed on the form, {{{REDACTED-person}}}, a spokesperson for ActBlue, told us in an email. We pass along the contribution directly to the receiving campaign or entity. We do not choose the recipient of the contribution, the donor does. In a statement to FactCheck.org, the Black Lives Matter Global Network’s managing director, Kai{{{REDACTED-person}}}, said that the claims about the money being routed to Democrats are part of an organized disinformation campaign against BLM, from actors clearly trying to blunt the growing support for this movement. All contributions to the DNC are publicly reported to the FEC and review of FEC reports will confirm there has never been any donation from this organization, she said. The Operations of the Black Lives Matter Global Network The claims seem to have flourished amid confusion over the structure of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which is incorporated in Delaware. The ActBlue donations page on the website specifically says that the money given will benefit Black Lives Matter Global Network. Technically, the network also has structured a foundation — the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation — which is fiscally sponsored by a global nonprofit called Thousand Currents, according to {{{REDACTED-person}}}, director of finance and administration at Thousand Currents. The partnership between the network and the nonprofit (formerly the International Development Exchange) was announced in 2016. The nonprofit organization said it would provide fiduciary oversight, financial management, and other administrative services to BLM. Cade, the ActBlue spokesperson, confirmed that the donations made through ActBlue go to Thousand Currents for Black Lives Matter. Using a fiscal sponsorship arrangement offers a way for a cause to attract donors even when it is not yet recognized as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), according to the National Council on Nonprofits. In essence the fiscal sponsor serves as the administrative ‘home’ of the cause. Charitable contributions are given to the fiscal sponsor, which then grants them to support the cause. Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation is an organization within Thousand Currents, de Rivera said in a phone interview, so it can accomplish its charitable purpose prior to receiving its approval from the IRS for its own 501(c)(3). De Rivera said the foundation has applied to become its own 501(c)(3). We asked the Black Lives Matter group for a copy of its Form 1023, which is used to apply for that designation, but didn’t hear back. An IRS spokesperson said copies are only publicly available if the organization is approved for 501(c)(3) status. On the claims that money is being given to Democratic campaigns, de Rivera said that Thousand Currents’ own 501(c)(3) status would be in jeopardy if charitable donations made through the organization were rerouted to political campaigns. According to the IRS, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. A Thousand Currents audit for 2019 shows that, as of {{{REDACTED-date}}}, the organization held nearly $3.4 million in net assets for Black Lives Matter. It had released nearly $1.8 million to the group in the last fiscal year. The audit also provides a breakdown of how the foundation (referred to as the fiscal project under a statement of functional expenses, according to de Rivera) spent that $1.8 million in buckets — including on consultants and salaries. Speaking generally about the issue of fiscal sponsorships, {{{REDACTED-person}}}, a law professor at American University who specializes in the regulation of nonprofits, told us by phone that the sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that the sponsored organization spends the money in a way that is consistent with the law. He said the sponsored organization does not have to file its own Forms 990. And, Leff said in an email, because ActBlue Charities is also a 501(c)(3), it is his understanding … that both ActBlue Charities and Thousand Currents have a legal obligation to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the funds they receive are spent consistent with 501(c)(3) restrictions. On {{{REDACTED-date}}}, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation said in a press release that, thanks to donations, it would make $6.5 million available through grants that will be available to all chapters affiliated with it.

It's a small sample but so far he does exactly what you want from a pitcher; get whiffs, limit walks and induce ground balls. I'm starting to think he might be drafted as Top-25 starting pitcher heading into next season.n• Like last season, {{{REDACTED-person}}} got off to a slow start in the power department this year. That's not the case anymore, however, as he's now homered in three straight. Additionally, he has multiple hits in seven of his past 10 games. If you stuck with him throughout his slow start, enjoy reaping the benefits over these final few weeks.n• {{{REDACTED-person}}} is back. After a down season in 2019, he looks like the Jeffress of old. He locked down his sixth save of the season Tuesday, including the fourth consecutive save for the Chicago Cubs. He certainly seems like the go-to guy for manager {{{REDACTED-person}}}. Through his first 15 games this season, Jeffress has a 1.06 ERA and a 0.82 WHIP. In the words of Borat, very nice!n• Man, what are the Dodgers thinking? {{{REDACTED-person}}} clearly isn't himself and now it seems like they rushed him back from his blister issue. According to manager {{{REDACTED-person}}}, the plan is for B{{{REDACTED-person}}} to make his next start although there will be discussions and that nothing's off the table. Buehler last just 2.2 innings on Tuesday, allowing five runs (two earned). It's been quite a weird season for the {{{REDACTED-age}}}.n• If we're talking weird seasons, let's throw J.D. {{{REDACTED-person}}} in the mix. It looks like Martinez was showing signs of life recently and then came to a crashing halt, going 0-for-12 over his last three games. He's struggled big time against right-handed pitching this season to the tune of just a .652 OPS. Like I mentioned in the open, I think Martinez is one of those names you can bench if you have better options, especially in a three-outfielder league.n• It looks like we've hit the end of the road for {{{REDACTED-person}}}. After a nice start to the season, Dobnak has been knocked around in two of his last three starts. On Tuesday, he allowed five runs in just 2.2 innings pitched. His next start comes against the White Sox and, considering Dobnak pitches to contact, I'm not really a fan of that matchup. I'd be OK dropping him for {{{REDACTED-person}}}e or {{{REDACTED-person}}} if they're available.", response.filteredText().trim());
